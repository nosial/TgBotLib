# TgBotLib

TgBotLib is a library for creating Telegram Bots in PHP, based on the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

The approach taken by this library is to be as close as possible to the Telegram Bot API, while providing a simple and
easy to use interface that is easy to understand and out of your way, allowing you to use the library as a simple
native around the API.
